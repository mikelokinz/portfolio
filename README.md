Michael John Franklin - Developer Portfolio
A responsive, interactive, and "hacker-themed" personal portfolio website built with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📖 About
This project is a personal portfolio showcasing my journey as a B.E. Computer Science student. It highlights my skills in Web Development (MERN), Mobile Development (Flutter), and Video Editing.




The design features a dark, navy-themed UI inspired by modern developer aesthetics, complete with smooth scroll animations, hidden easter eggs, and a fully functional "Chaos Mode."

✨ Key Features
🎨 Design & UI
Fully Responsive: optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Dark Mode Theme: Uses a sophisticated Navy/Slate/Green color palette.

Scroll Animations: Elements fade in and slide up as you scroll (IntersectionObserver).

Side Orientation Bars: Fixed social media links and email address on the sides of the screen.

🕹️ Interactive Easter Eggs
This site contains several hidden developer "treats":

Konami Code: Type ↑ ↑ ↓ ↓ ← → ← → b a to trigger "God Mode" (screen rotation).

Theme Swap: Click the MJF Logo in the top left 5 times to swap the color accent from Green to Cyber-Punk Pink.

Chaos Mode: A "Do Not Press" button in the footer that triggers a Matrix rain canvas and a terminal hacking simulation.

Console Logs: Custom messages hidden in the browser developer tools.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Semantic structure.

JavaScript (ES6+): DOM manipulation, Canvas API (for Matrix effect), Event Listeners.
